# GraphStudioNext-Enhanced

[GraphStudioNext](https://github.com/cplussharp/graph-studio-next) is a DirectShow graph editor. It's an open source alternative to [Microsoft Graph Edit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd407274.aspx) in the [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk) with many additional features.

GraphStudioNext is a fork of [RadScorpion's](http://blog.monogram.sk/janos/) [GraphStudio](http://blog.monogram.sk/janos/tools/monogram-graphstudio/).
Because development had stopped on the really useful tool GraphStudio, I started this fork. I use this application every day and I needed some new features to support my workflows and wanted to fix some really annoying bugs.
